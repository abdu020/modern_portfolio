        <p>I'm a 20-year-old who lives in Copenhagen and loves to code. I just recently finished high school, and
          currently holding a gap-year. The reason why I choose to do that was so I could practice web
          development and once I felt comfortable with it, I wanted to apply for a job as a Junior Web Developer to get
          some experience. Down below you can see what programming languages and frameworks I have learned. I also
          included things I have worked on in the past as a part-time freelancer on <a style="color: yellow" href="https://www.fiverr.com/caprisonne915#!">Fiverr.</a>
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to Web Development, the first three languages I learned where HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I
          started creating simple static web pages, but after some time I wanted to expand upon that and started
          learning PHP and Mysqli with the purpose of implementing backend functionalities such as a login system and a
          database where I could store information. <br>
          <br>
          After that, I did a couple of projects such as building a WordPress
          theme from scracth using bootstrap which is a front-end framework. To see some of these projects live go to
          "MY WORK" or

          account.
