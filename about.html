        <p>I'm a 20-year-old who lives in Copenhagen and loves to code. I just recently finished high school, and
          currently holding a gap-year. The reason why I choose to do that was so I could practice web
          development and once I felt comfortable with it, I wanted to apply for a job as a Junior Web Developer to get
          some experience. Down below you can see what programming languages and frameworks I have learned. I also
          included things I have worked on in the past as a part-time freelancer on <a style="color: yellow" href="https://www.fiverr.com/caprisonne915#!">Fiverr.</a>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: yellow">Web Development</h3>
        <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
        <p>When it comes to Web Development, the first three languages I learned where HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I
          started creating simple static web pages, but after some time I wanted to expand upon that and started
          learning PHP and Mysqli with the purpose of implementing backend functionalities such as a login system and a
          database where I could store information. <br>
          <br>
          After that, I did a couple of projects such as building a WordPress
          theme from scracth using bootstrap which is a front-end framework. To see some of these projects live go to
          "MY WORK" or

        <p>As a social media manager for Powersetter, a company comparing electricity which is located in New York, my
          main
          task was their social media where I was responsible for building their Instagram profile. The company wanted
          to raise awareness about their brand. The profile got 700 followers within the first month of managing
          it, getting around 100 likes per post. <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/caprisonne915/do-professional-instagram-management-8323fe4c-12d7-4847-81d0-956d1eb07d2c"
